fix: Resolve "Cannot find Active meeting" error when ending meetings

## Problem
Users encountered "Cannot find Active meeting. Please try refreshing the page." 
error when attempting to end meetings, particularly:
- After page refresh
- When ending follow-up meetings from Today's Meetings
- In scenarios with network delays

## Root Cause
1. Weak meeting lookup logic that didn't check meeting's followUpId field
2. Incomplete state restoration after page refresh
3. No fallback mechanisms when primary lookup failed

## Solution
Enhanced meeting lookup with multi-level fallback system:

### 1. Multi-Level Meeting Lookup
- Priority 1: Search by followUpId in meetings array (most reliable)
- Priority 2: Find any active meeting by status
- Priority 3: Check startedMeetingMap cache
- Only show error if all 3 methods fail

### 2. Improved State Restoration
- Restore mappings for ALL active meetings (not just first)
- Preserve existing mappings instead of clearing
- Handle multiple active meetings properly

### 3. Enhanced Data Retrieval
- Check followUpDataMap by meeting ID
- Search todaysFollowUpMeetings by follow-up ID
- Match by meeting's followUpId field

### 4. Better Error Handling
- Replaced alert() with toast notifications
- Added "started" status to active meeting checks
- Improved error messages and logging

## Changes
- Modified: client/pages/Tracking.tsx
  - handleEndMeetingFromFollowUp(): Enhanced with 3-level lookup
  - fetchMeetings(): Improved state restoration for all active meetings
  - handleEndMeetingAttempt(): Better error handling with toast
  - Added detailed console logging for debugging

## Testing
✅ Normal meeting end (no follow-up)
✅ Follow-up meeting end (happy path)
✅ Follow-up meeting end after page refresh
✅ Multiple browser tabs
✅ Network delay simulation
✅ No active meeting edge case

## Impact
- Zero "Cannot find active meeting" errors expected
- Meetings can be ended reliably after page refresh
- Better user experience with clear error messages
- Backward compatible with existing meetings

- QUICK_FIX_REFERENCE_END_MEETING.md - Quick reference
- END_MEETING_FLOW_DIAGRAM.md - Visual diagrams
- DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST_END_MEETING_FIX.md - Deployment guide

## Database
No schema changes required. Uses existing followUpId field.

## Backward Compatibility
✅ Meetings without followUpId still work
✅ Existing meetings unaffected
✅ Old "Start Meeting" flow unchanged
